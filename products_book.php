                    exercise by the writer that emerges as her inaugural entrance into the next chapter of her life as
                    an author. She shares her day-to-day concerns, thoughts, vulnerabilities, and struggles. But more
                    than that, she opens herself up to visiting the places in her mind and heart where God lives. In
                    these places, she hears from God. The most mindboggling revelation in this book was recorded on May
                    29, 2014, where she speaks prophetically about publishing this journal. Three years later, it has
                    come to fruition. She also shares her deep desire to complete a long process of learning. Three
                    years later, she emerges as Dr. Brenda Arnold-Scott, having completed all doctoral work. This
                    journal is written to encourage the whosoever’s to take 30 days to write their hearts; that they
                    might determine their new starts! <b>Cost $15.99; plus $5.00 shipping and handling</b></p>
